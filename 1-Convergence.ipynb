    "<p>It's very difficult oftentimes to get reproducibility in molecular dynamics. So \"convergence\" is the idea that if you run a simulation for LONG enough, it will ultimately \"converge\" at one point. So how do you determine if your data has converged? Some ways:\n",
    "<p>1. Run all simulations in triplicate (which is just good experimental practice) because then you can report standard deviation of all measurements. <p>2. Run your simulation for a long, long time  <p> Unfortunately, monolayer systems are difficult, because they haven't been studied in the computational community for very long. You'll find some papers that ran theirs for 5ns and some than ran for 150 ns. So it's up to us to decide HOW LONG we should be running these things, and this module will help you do *ACTUAL* analysis for me on this question. <p>To do this, we'll look at some NAMD simulations that I've completed."
